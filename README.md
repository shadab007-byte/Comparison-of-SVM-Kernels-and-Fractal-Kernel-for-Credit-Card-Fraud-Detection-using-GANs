## üöÄ Overview

This project addresses the challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for data augmentation and **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** enhanced with novel **fractal-based kernels** for classification.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

Credit card fraud detection is a classic imbalanced classification problem, with fraudulent transactions constituting less than 1% of all transactions. Traditional methods struggle with such imbalance and fail to capture complex, nonlinear fraud patterns. This project systematically compares traditional SVM kernels with custom fractal-based kernels, using GAN-augmented data for robust training and evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Augmentation with CTGAN**
- **Original Dataset:** European credit card dataset (284,807 transactions, 492 frauds)
- **CTGAN Synthesis:** Generated synthetic fraud samples to balance the dataset (2,000 legitimate vs 984 fraudulent transactions)
- **Result:** Significantly improved model training and evaluation fairness

### 2. **SVM Kernel Comparison**
- **Traditional Kernels:** Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), Sigmoid
- **Fractal-Based Kernels:** Fractal RBF, Mercer Fractal RBF, Alpha-Fractal Kernel
- **Implementation:** Custom kernel matrices for fractal variants

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrices, ROC curves, kernel response plots

---

## üí° Key Innovations

- **Fractal Kernel Design:** Introduced recursive and Hermite-based fractal kernels to capture self-similar and complex patterns in transaction data.
- **CTGAN Integration:** Used Conditional Tabular GAN to generate realistic synthetic fraud samples, addressing class imbalance without oversampling bias.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Compared traditional and fractal kernels, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Linear              | 0.9754   | 0.9891    | 0.9349 | 0.9599   | 0.9877  |
| Polynomial          | 0.9576   | 1.0000    | 0.8699 | 0.9304   | 0.9869  |
| RBF (Gaussian)      | 0.9710   | 1.0000    | 0.9110 | 0.9534   | 0.9848  |
| Sigmoid             | 0.9263   | 0.9346    | 0.8322 | 0.8804   | 0.8694  |
| Fractal RBF         | 0.9699   | 0.9752    | 0.9322 | 0.9532   | ‚Äî       |
| Mercer Fractal RBF  | 0.9688   | 0.9652    | 0.9390 | 0.9519   | ‚Äî       |
| Alpha-Fractal       | 0.76     | 0.99/0.58 | 0.66/0.98 | 0.79/0.73 | ‚Äî       |

> **Note:** Alpha-Fractal kernel prioritizes fraud recall (0.98) at the cost of some false positives, which is critical for financial security.
